# coreutils

While there are many implementations of core utilities (busybox, toybox, GNU coreutils, ubase, sbase, BSD utils, etc), this guide strives for the most basic bitch of installs.
By default anyways.

Something to keep in mind is that you don't need to restrict yourself to just one set of core utilities, some provide additional functionality over others.

Download, extract, configure, build, install. You get the idea by now, it's the same soup, just reheated. That's literally all Linux is -- a bowl of reheated soup.
